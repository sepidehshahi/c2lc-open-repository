title: "Examining Applications for Accessibility"
---

This framework is intended to support educators as they explore and consider appropriate activities for coding instruction with their students who experience learning challenges.  The considerations outlined below include those that should be considered within the design interface as well as instructional supports, such as pre-teaching, scaffolded instruction and adapted resources to support explicit and accessible instruction.

## Accessibility Considerations

|Potential Barrier|Severity of Barrier (0 - 5) (How inaccessible does this make it for your students?)|Potential Solutions (AT Tools, Instructional Strategies, Modifications)|
|---------|--------|--------|
|**Reading**| | |
|There are text instructions that require reading (i.e. are not presented auditorily or supported by images).| | |
|Text is used to label/categorize and is not accessible auditorily or supported by images.| | |
|There is challenging vocabulary used that is not explained.| | |
|There are tooltips/hints that require reading (i.e. are not presented auditorily or supported by images).| | |
|**Writing**| | |
|Students are required to type correctly spelled commands in order to carry out tasks.| | |
|Students are required to type correctly spelled commands in order to carry out tasks.| | |
|**Cognitive**| | |
|Students are required to store information and recall it later to carry out a task.| | |
|Students are required to follow a large number of steps sequentially that are not broken down. | | |
|Students are required to have an understanding /prior knowledge of certain concepts in order to carry out tasks. (i.e. left/right, sequencing) | | |
|Students are required to follow fast paced instructions. | | |
|Students are required to follow instructions that are provided auditorily but not visually. | | |
|Students are required to navigate across multiple screens. | | |
|**Visual Perceptual**| | |
|Students are required to have good spatial awareness to carry out the task. | | |
|**Fine Motor** | | |
|Students are required to move items seamlessly using a small, single point of contact (i.e. finger) | | |
|Students are required to manipulate small objects in close proximity. | | |
|Students are required to effectively use a mouse (i.e. for scrolling, clicking and dragging) | | |
|Students are required to perform complex gestures to carry out tasks. (i.e. pinch, 3 finger tap) | | |
|Students are required to put together small pieces of machinery. | | |
|Students are required to use small tools. | | |
|Students use alternate access devices for keyboard and mouse functions. | | |

**NOTE**:  Be sure to check the compatibility of a student's current support products with the coding application(s) being considered. Also consider whether the use of the products requires instruction prior to expecting them to support coding instruction.
