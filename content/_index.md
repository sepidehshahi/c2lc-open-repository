Welcome to the [Coding to Learn and Create](https://www.codelearncreate.org/) project **Educator's Toolkit**!

This toolkit aims to provide teachers with resources they may need to support their students' individual needs and preferences. We encourage the education community to contribute to the content of this toolkit and share their strategies, techniques and activities here to build a rich resource that can address a broad range of needs.

Here are some of the items you will find within the current toolkit:
