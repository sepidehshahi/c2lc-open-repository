title: Direction Arrow
---

This activity was designed to support students as they learn to use directions (forward, right, left and backward) to program a partner to move around the room.

1. Print multiple copies of this arrow.
2. Cut around the outline so that students have square sheets of paper with one arrow on each page.
3. Use the arrows to create a path on the floor for partner to follow.
