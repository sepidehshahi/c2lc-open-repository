In this activity, students plan and build a path to direct Dash to move to a specific object on a grid map.


- **Difficulty Level**: Moderate
- **Preparation time**: 8-10 minutes
- **Materials**: Objects, tape, 8-16 printed grid tiles [Download Grid Tile Document](/PDF/GridTile.pdf)

Place the printed grid tiles together on a hard and flat surface and tape their edges to secure it in place.

**Tip:** If you are doing this activity on a tabletop or an elevated surface, block the edges to prevent robots from falling.

**Tip:** If you don't have access to a printer, you can draw a grid map on a large sheet of paper or use masking tape to build a grid on the floor.

## Step 2

Once your map is ready, place a few items such as toys on different spots on the map.

**Tip:** You can use any object, draw or write something on the map.

Select a starting point for your robot, place it on the map and start using the coding environment to make your robot move to different items on the map.

**Tip:** To make this fun, build a story around the objects on your map and give Dash a specific mission to accomplish.
